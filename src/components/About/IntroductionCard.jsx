                As the footer have stated, this website is a project website for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://innoacademy.hkstp.org/dtt.html" style={{ color: "inherit" }}>1<sup>st</sup> Hong Kong Science Park DeepTech Talents Training Programme</a>.
                It was a 6-day bootcamp, joined by 100 talents around Hong Kong.
                As an evaluation after the 6-day lessons, the programme introduced a mini project on predicting the vacancy of carparks in Hong Kong.
                I and my teammates had successfully developed a machine learning model by on Tree-based model in Python.
                And I would like to take this opportunity to create a website for this project.
